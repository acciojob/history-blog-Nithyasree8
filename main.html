	<h1>History</h1> 
	<b>Main articles:History og blogging and online diary</b>
    <p>An early example of a <b>“diary” style blog</b> consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, 1995. The term <b>“weblog”</b> was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997. The short form, <b>“blog”</b>, was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase <b>“we blog”</b> in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used <b>“blog”</b> as both a noun and verb (“to blog”, meaning “to edit one’s weblog or to post to one’s weblog”) and devised the term <b>“blogger”</b> in connection with Pyra Labs Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.</p>
